The list and explanation of projects I have done

- Making an assembler with use of RISC-V 
- Game recommender based on what genre someone likes - implemented in Java
  This recommendation system helps users determine what souls game to start off with, the souls games series being somewhat of a genre of its own, working to turn this into a website.
- Calculator that performs basic tasks - implemented in Java
  This calculator given user input of 2 numbers and an operand, can perform operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction and division.
- Hangman game in python
  A fun party game, guessing wrong adds to the "man" who is on the noose.
